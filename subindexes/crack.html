        <p class="explain">
            This is a study I am contributing to from a computational aspect. Essentially, this study observes multiphase flow through granular and porous materials. This will eventually lead some insight
            into the "mode of gas invasion in sediments at the pore level governing whether methane hydrate forms as concentrated veins that are useful for energy production, or instead in a much more disperse manner" (from the study linked above).

        <h3 style="margin: 12px;"><a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~donev/Packing/C++/">Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm in C++, derived from an NYU study</a></h3>
        <div class="break"></div>
        <p class="explain">
            By utilizing the NYU study and code above, I have generated "soft-wall" 2D sphere packing in a square domain. The red circles indicate the boundary layer applied after-the-fact. 
            The output of the NYU C++ script is a dat file which is a list of all coordinates and radii of the entitites generated. 

            <br>
            Certain notable features observed, particularly in Figure 3, are domains of the generated spheres and their boundaries. There are also displacements, whose movements would be impeded as 
            macroscopic deformations are applied (such as pure tension of a steel specimen, which requires displacements from the center to move towards the outside of the specimen).

            <br>
            This is an on-going study! Please ask me any updates since. The current code I am using is purely 2D sphere packing. Next steps are to generate a cylindrical packing of monodisperse spheres with "hard-wall" boundaries, and to possibly modify the script so as to
            add calculations of moments into the Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm.
