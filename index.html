                <p>Hey, my name is Joshua Kang. I am Class of 2023 from Duke studying Mechanical Engineering (BSE) and Computer Science (BA). </p>
                <br>
                <p>My personal interests are disciplines that incorporate both fields of study, and I am trying to study more into fields relevant to defense engineering as well.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I also worked as videographer for Duke Football. Go Blue Devils!</p>

                        remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

                        He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually
                        communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
                        meant a great deal more than that.

                        In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
                        many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not
                        a few veteran bores.

                        The abnormal mind is quick to detect and
                        attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person,
                        and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
                        being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of
                        wild, unknown men.
